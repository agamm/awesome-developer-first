A curated list of awesome developer-first tools, products and resources.  

The definition of developer-first for this repo is:
* Developers as the target audience.
* "Headless", "API-First", "SaaS" are frequently used keywords.
* Usually this means that the front page has some code examples :)

Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).
