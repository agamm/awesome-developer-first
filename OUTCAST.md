## Outcased

These are entries that were almost up for being in the main readme but I've decided they are not developer-first or aren't as awesome as the other entries.



## Analytics
* [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) - Has good analytics APIs, directly measure KPIs. [Not developer-first enough]


## Monitoring
* [LogDNA](https://logdna.com/) - Log management and alerts. [Not developer-first enough]
