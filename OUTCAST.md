## Outcased

These are entries that were almost up for being in the main readme but I've decided they are not developer-first or aren't as awesome as the other entries.

## Analytics
* [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) - Has good analytics APIs, directly measure KPIs. [Not developer-first enough]

## Computer Vision
* [Scanbot SDK](https://scanbot.io/) - Structured data extraction from images for applications. [Not developer-first enough]

## Monitoring
* [LogDNA](https://logdna.com/) - Log management and alerts. [Not developer-first enough]
* [Dashbird](https://dashbird.io/) - Serverless realtime monitoring. [Not developer-first enough]
* [Statuspal](https://statuspal.io) - Public/Private status pages for services with integrations. [Not developer-first enough]
* [instatus](https://instatus.com) - Minimalist Jamstack status page. [Not developer-first enough]
